# Firebase Setup Guide for Bicycle Workshop Management

## üî• Firebase Configuration

To use Firebase with your Bicycle Workshop Management system, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a Firebase Project

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Click "Create a project" or "Add project"
3. Enter your project name (e.g., "bicycle-workshop")
4. Enable Google Analytics (optional)
5. Click "Create project"

### 2. Enable Firestore Database

1. In your Firebase project console, click "Firestore Database"
2. Click "Create database"
3. Choose "Start in test mode" (for development)
4. Select a location for your database
5. Click "Done"

### 3. Get Your Firebase Configuration

1. In your Firebase project console, click the gear icon ‚öôÔ∏è (Project settings)
2. Scroll down to "Your apps" section
3. Click the web icon `</>` to add a web app
4. Enter an app nickname (e.g., "workshop-web")
5. Click "Register app"
6. Copy the configuration object

### 4. Update firebase-config.js

Replace the placeholder values in `firebase-config.js` with your actual Firebase configuration:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-actual-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-project-id.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-actual-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project-id.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "your-actual-sender-id",
  appId: "your-actual-app-id"
};
```

### 5. Set Up Firestore Security Rules (Optional)

For production, update your Firestore security rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow read/write access to all documents
    // Update these rules based on your security requirements
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

### 6. Test Your Setup

1. Open your application in a web browser
2. Go to the "Database" tab
3. If you see a migration section, your local data can be migrated to Firebase
4. If you see Firebase connection status, you're ready to go!
